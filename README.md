Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to get your local copy working follow these few steps.

1. Signup for Firebase, and add a new app from your dashboard: https://www.firebase.com/account/
 1. (Optional) Setup Free hosting provided by Firebase https://ng-demo.firebaseio.com/?page=Hosting and follow the instructions, or use your own hosting. You don't need this if you are running a local server but would be nice to use this as our staging server.
 2. Go to your newly created app url and Import `app-content/ng-store-export.json` file for our demo configurations.
3. change the `.value('fbURL', 'https://ng-store.firebaseio.com/');` in `app/main.js` and `app-admin/main.js` to your newly created firebase app URL.
4. Install Node modules by running `$ npm install`.. (*Note:* Install Grunt CLI, SASS and Compass if you have not already)
5. Run Grunt tasks `$ grunt`
