# Firebase Simple Login - Web Client

Firebase Simple Login is a simple, easy-to-use authentication service built on
top of [Firebase Custom Login](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/custom-login.html),
allowing you to authenticate users without any server code.

Enable authentication via a number of third-party providers, anonymous login, or email / password authentication without having to manually store authentication credentials or run a server.

## Installation

To install in your application, [load  from the Firebase CDN](https://www.firebase.com/docs/downloads.html),
or install with Bower:

```bash
$ bower install firebase-simple-login
```

The only dependencies are `firebase.js`, the Firebase web client.

See [https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-overview.html](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-overview.html)
for complete documentation and API reference.

## Configuration

Firebase Simple Login supports email & password, Facebook, Google,
GitHub, Twitter, and anonymous authentication methods. Before adding to
your application, you'll need to first enable these auth. providers in your app.

To get started, visit the Simple Login tab in Firebase Forge, at
`https://<YOUR-FIREBASE>.firebaseio.com`. There you may enable / disable auth.
providers, setup OAuth credentials, and configure valid OAuth request origins.

__Note:__ Persona was removed as an authentication provider in Firebase Simple
Login as of version 1.5.0.

## Usage

Start monitoring user authentication state in your application by instantiating
the Firebase Simple Login client with a Firebase reference, and callback.

This `function(error, user)` callback will be invoked once after instantiation,
and again every time the user's authentication state changes:

```javascript
var ref = new Firebase('https://<YOUR-FIREBASE>.firebaseio.com');
var auth = new FirebaseSimpleLogin(ref, function(error, user) {
  if (error) {
    // an error occurred while attempting login
    console.log(error);
  } else if (user) {
    // user authenticated to Firebase reference
    console.log('User ID: ' + user.id + ', Provider: ' + user.provider);
  } else {
    // user is logged out
  }
});
```

If the user is logged out, try authenticating using the provider of your choice:

```javascript
auth.login('<provider>'); // 'password', 'facebook', 'github', 'google', etc.
```
